# http-stream

A Demonstration of a simple HTTP server that streams data to a client. The server sends a stream of data to the client, and the client displays the data as it is received.

A practical use case for this would be something like a Large Language Model (LLM) that is generating text in real-time. The server would send the generated text to the client as it is generated, and the client would display the text as it is received (e.g., ChatGPT). 

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```
